# Mammogram Mass Analyzer
This is a free desktop computer aided diagnosis (CAD) tool that uses computer vision to detect and localize masses on full field digital mammograms.
It's a flask app that's running on the desktop.

My aim was to create a proof of concept for a free desktop computer aided diagnosis (CAD) system that could be used as an aid when diagnosing breast cancer. Unlike a web app, this tool does not need an internet connection and there are no monthly server rental costs. I think a desktop tool could be helpful to radiologists in private practice and to medical non-profits that work in remote areas.

1- Runs locally therefore no internet connection is needed.<br>
2- Accepts dicom files.<br>
3- Uses the CPU for inference<br>
4- The results are explainable because the app outputs images with bounding boxes.<br>
5- If you know flask, html, css and a bit of javascrpt - you can easily modify this app for other computer vision projects.
